What You Should Implement
Master Password + Key Derivation

Use scrypt or argon2 to derive a secure encryption key from the master password.

Store only the hash of the master password (never the password itself).

AES or ChaCha20 Encryption

Encrypt each password entry using AES-GCM or ChaCha20-Poly1305.

Use unique nonces/IVs for each entry to prevent pattern leaks.

Secure Storage

Store encrypted entries in a local file (e.g., JSON or BoltDB).

Optionally encrypt the entire file with a master key.

Clipboard Auto-Clear

Copy passwords to clipboard and auto-clear after a few seconds to reduce exposure.

Password Strength Meter

Evaluate password strength using entropy or pattern analysis.

Warn users about weak or reused passwords.

Audit Features

Track password age and flag old entries.

Optional breach check via public APIs (like HaveIBeenPwned).

Auto-Lock & Timeout

Lock the app after inactivity.

Require re-authentication to access stored data.

Import/Export with Encryption

Allow encrypted backups and secure imports.

Use password-protected export files.
